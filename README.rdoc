= Demo application for Rails internalization API

Simple & minimal Rails application to test the new Rails internationalization and localization API

It evolved from following excellent review from Trevor Turk, available at 
http://www.almosteffortless.com/2008/07/21/simple-localization-in-rails-22

Tries to set some reasonable pattern to load translation files and set locale 
either from request domain (.com, .de, etc) or request params.

*Includes translation file* for Czech language so you can easily roll your own Spanish, German, Polish, 
etc version just by duplicating the file, renaming it and changing the translation strings. 
After server restart you should see your language in language bar at the top of the page.

== Installation & Requirements

* Download & unpack archive or <tt>git clone</tt> from Github [http://github.com/karmi/rails_i18n_demo_app]

* You <b>have to to run on 2.2 branch of Rails or later</b> for this app to work. Run this command in the app directory:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  
* If that should blow in your face like git submodules like to do, run this:

  rake rails:freeze:edge
  
* Run migrations (to be able to test ActiveRecord message localizations) by <tt>rake db:migrate</tt>
  
* Run <tt>script/server</tt> and point your browser at http://localhost:3000

== About setting the locale from the request domain

Usually the most sane approach to setting locale/language version of the application is 
from the domain: <tt>application.com</tt> loads English, <tt>application.es</tt> Spanish. This works best
for content heavy websites and search engines love it.

The <tt>ApplicationController#extract_locale_from_uri</tt> sets locale from the domain.
To test this, you have to edit <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> by inserting lines like:

  127.0.0.1 application.com
  127.0.0.1 application.cz

Then just load your application as usual at <tt>http://application.cz:3000</tt> or <tt>http://application.com:3000</tt> 
and you should see the locale being switched
